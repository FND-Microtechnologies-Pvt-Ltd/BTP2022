   abstract = {Semantic segmentation and depth estimation are two important tasks in computer vision, and many methods have been developed to tackle them. Commonly these two tasks are addressed independently, but recently the idea of merging these two problems into a sole framework has been studied under the assumption that integrating two highly correlated tasks may benefit each other to improve the estimation accuracy. In this paper, depth estimation and semantic segmentation are jointly addressed using a single RGB input image under a unified convolutional neural network. We analyze two different architectures to evaluate which features are more relevant when shared by the two tasks and which features should be kept separated to achieve a mutual improvement. Likewise, our approaches are evaluated under two different scenarios designed to review our results versus single-task and multi-task methods. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the performance of our methodology outperforms the state of the art on single-task approaches, while obtaining competitive results compared with other multi-task methods.},

   abstract = {We review solutions to the problem of depth estimation, arguably the most important subtask in scene understanding. We focus on the single image depth estimation problem. Due to its properties, the single image depth estimation problem is currently best tackled with machine learning methods, most successfully with convolutional neural networks. We provide an overview of the field by examining key works. We examine non-deep learning approaches that mostly predate deep learning and utilize hand-crafted features and assumptions, and more recent works that mostly use deep learning techniques. The single image depth estimation problem is tackled first in a supervised fashion with absolute or relative depth information acquired from human or sensor-labeled data, or in an unsupervised way using unlabelled stereo images or video datasets. We also study multitask approaches that combine the depth estimation problem with related tasks such as semantic segmentation and surface normal estimation. Finally, we discuss investigations into the mechanisms, principles, and failure cases of contemporary solutions.},
